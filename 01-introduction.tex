\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Foreword}
This document details a Dungeon World-like tabletop roleplay system for the mecha genre. The creation of this system was motivated by a number of problems faced while playing Mekton Zeta, notably:
\begin{itemize}
\item The amount of time and work required to create a mecha.
\item Lack of roleplaying incentives
\item Overwhelming rule complexity.
\end{itemize}

Conversely, when I played Dungeon World, I was impressed by its ability to integrate the fiction and roleplaying into the mechanics. I want to bring this playstyle to my Mekton Zeta campaign, and whilst creating a whole new system rather than being a better GM may seem like overkill, it will certainly be fun.
