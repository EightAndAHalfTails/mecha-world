\section{Moves}
The moves are the blood of a *-World game, and they keep the game, well, moving. Any move consists of a trigger, and an action. A success generally means the player gets their desired outcome, a partial success is still a success, but a slightly worse overall outcome, and a failure means the GM can make a move.

Class- and Mecha-specific moves will be treated in their own sections, so the basic moves accessible to everyone (human or giant robot) will be detailed here.

\item It's not quite what you wanted.
\item It comes with strings attached, or a favour owed.
\end{itemize}}
{they don't have it, sorry.}
