\section{Moves}
The moves are the blood of a *-World game, and they keep the game, well, moving. Any move consists of a trigger, and an action. A success generally means the player gets their desired outcome, a partial success is still a success, but with an added drawback invented by the GM, and a failure means the GM can make a move.

Class- and Mecha-specific moves will be treated in their own sections, so the basic moves accessible to everyone (human or giant robot) will be detailed here.
