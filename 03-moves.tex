\section{Moves}
The moves are the blood of a *-World game, and they keep the game,
well, moving. Any move consists of a trigger, and an action. A success
generally means the player gets their desired outcome, a partial
success is still a success, but a slightly worse overall outcome, and
a failure means the GM can make a move.

Class- and Mecha-specific moves will be treated in their own sections,
so the basic moves accessible to everyone (human or giant robot) will
be detailed here.

Assuming you have time to react, Roll+Stat:

\subsection{Special Moves}

\movedesc{Intermission}{settle in to rest and maintain your mecha} restore all depleted Mecha Items. If you have enough experience, you may level up. When you wake from at least a few uninterrupted hours of sleep heal damage equal to half your max HP.

\movedesc{Encumbrance}{make a move while carrying weight}{you may be encumbered. If your weight carried is:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Equal to or less than your load, you suffer no penalty
\item Less than or equal to your load$+2$, you take $-1$ ongoing until you lighten your burden
\item Greater than your load$+2$, you have a choice: drop at least 1 weight and roll at $-1$, or automatically fail
\end{itemize}

\move{Source Parts}{browse a store's catalogue for mundane mecha parts, personal items, or repairs}{Talk}
{they have what you need, and you can get a good deal}
{they have what you need, for about what you expected}
{they have what you need, but it costs more than you thought it would}

\movenofail{Rare Parts}{make a request to a store for rare mecha parts}{Talk and describe what you're looking for}
{they happen to have it in, or the nearest thing that exists, and you can have it for the right price}
{they have it, or can get it, but there's a catch. The GM will choose one:
\begin{itemize}
\item It costs a lot.
\item It's not quite what you wanted.
\item It comes with strings attached, or a favour owed.
\end{itemize}}

\movedesc{End Of Session}{reach the end of the session}{answer the following three questions as a group}
\begin{itemize}
\item Did we learn something new and important about the world?
\item Did we overcome a notable enemy?
\item Did we meet an interesting character?
\end{itemize}

For each ``yes'' answer everyone marks experience.

Choose a character who knows you better than they used to. If there's
more than one, choose one at your whim. Tell that player to add 1 to
their Hx with you on their sheet. If this brings them to Hx$+4$, they
reset to Hx$+1$ (and therefore mark experience).
