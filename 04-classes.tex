\subsection{Swordsmaster}
{\itshape These fools lack honour and discipline. Look at them now, laughing carelessly over a shared lunch. They could be attacked right now, and only you would be able to defend yourself. While they waste away their time you sit here, tirelessly drawing and resheathing your sword to shave off those precious milliseconds that could mean the difference between life and death.

A warrior's life is tough, to be sure, but it has its rewards. What are they to you? To lay down your life in defense of your lord, like the samurai of old? Or do you prefer to feel the breath of your enemy leave them, while you bask in the knowledge that when it came right down to it, you were better than them? Whatever your goal, you will find it hard to attain with these weaklings around. They lack honour and discipline, but you can change that.}

\subsection{Hikikomori}
{\itshape What was that noise? Is someone there? Maybe if you're quiet enough, they'll think you're not in. You shun outside contact. Friends only ever let you down. To support yourself, here, with your own two hands is enough. Well, in addition to the food your nice older sibling leaves outside your door.

The gentle hum of the machinery, the moonlight streaming in through the viewing port. This is the life. Solitude is not loneliness; that's what the others don't understand. Always asking what's wrong. They'll never understand you. Not like you do.}
