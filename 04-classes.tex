\subsection{Hikikomori}
{\itshape What was that noise? Is someone there? Maybe if you're quiet enough, they'll think you're not in. You shun outside contact. Friends only ever let you down. To support yourself, here, with your own two hands is enough. Well, in addition to the food your nice older sibling leaves outside your door.

The gentle hum of the machinery, the moonlight streaming in through the viewing port. This is the life. Solitude is not loneliness; that's what the others don't understand. Always asking what's wrong. They'll never understand you. Not like you do.}
