\subsection{Operator}
{\itshape You're not like the others, are you? They all fight for
  something, or maybe it's more accurate to say they all still have
  something worth fighting for. What do you have? A klunky
  piece-of-shit gun, battered body armour, and a hell of a lot of
  history.

How many people have you killed? Do you still remember each of their
faces? Of course you fucking don't. Whatever humanity you had went out
the window a long time ago. You're little more than machine now. Even
the mecha are more human than you are.}

% You *can* leave options which would imply an unintended target is hit, like the first choice in Burst
\subsubsection{Trigger Discipline} You never hit unintended targets with a weapon. You cannot pick options that explicitly cause this to happen, and if a move tells you that you hit unintended targets, ignore it.

\move{Deathwish}{walk out into a storm of bullets}{Cool}

{Choose a number of visible targets in range. Deal your damage to them, then take that many harm.}

\subsubsection{Stone Cold} You never have to \linkmove{Persevere} to shoot someone, no matter how high the stakes.

\subsection{Brawler}
{\itshape They always say weapons don't kill people, people do. Well,
  what are the weapons for, then? A weapon is nothing without a strong
  body wielding it. Look at the others. They think their pop-guns and
  glorified tree branches will protect them in a fight. Maybe, but
  where will they be when those weapons are taken away?

They call you names sometimes. ``Meathead'', they say. ``Numbskull'',
``Shit-For-Brains''. They laugh. Well, they'll be laughing on the
other side of their faces one day. When the enemy has them jailed, and
they see you removing the bars one by one like so many toothpicks. Or
maybe you'll just crush one of their skulls like a watermelon. Nobody
will be laughing then.}

% TODO Decide whether to focus on samurai or general swordplay
\subsection{Swordsmaster}
{\itshape These fools lack honour and discipline. Look at them now,
  laughing carelessly over a shared lunch. They could be attacked
  right this minute, and only you would be able to defend
  yourself. While they waste away their time you sit here, tirelessly
  drawing and resheathing your sword to shave off those precious
  milliseconds that could mean the difference between life and death.

A warrior's life is tough, to be sure, but it has its rewards. What
are they to you? To lay down your life in defense of your lord, like
the samurai of old? Or do you prefer to feel the breath of your enemy
leave them, while you bask in the knowledge that when it came right
down to it, you were better than them? Whatever your goal, you will
find it hard to attain with these weaklings around. They lack honour
and discipline, yes, but you can change that.}

\begin{itemize}
\item Pharmacology and Virology
\item Physics and Metaphysics
\item Computer Science and Cryptography
\item Engine Mechanics and Ballistics
\item Aeronautics and Astronautics
\end{itemize}
When you first encounter an important phenomenon (your call) covered by your area of expertise you can ask the GM any one question about it; the GM will answer truthfully. The GM may then ask you where you learned of or previously encountered the phenomenon.

\movedesc{Prototype}{have time and a supply of materials}{you may draw up designs for a new technological marvel. Describe what it does to the GM. Prototypes are always possible, but the GM may impose one or more of the following restrictions:}
\begin{itemize}
\item It's going to take time.
\item It will only work under certain circumstances.
\item You'll need the help of someone, the GM will say who.
\item It's going to cost you.
\item The best you can do is a less powerful or reliable version.
\item You’ll have to deconstruct something for the parts, the GM will say what.
\end{itemize}

% Tactician Inspiration: Lelouch, Maou, Light, Sora, 
\subsection{Tactician}
{\itshape How do you see the battlefield? Not just as the chaos of
  gunfire and explosions, but as something more\ldots concerted. You
  see the intention behind every bullet, the desperation behind every
  swing. When you look into the eyes of your enemies, you see their
  plans, motives, and weaknesses laid bare.

When you turn those eyes upon your friends, what do you see? Do you
reduce them in your mind down to a list of strengths and weaknesses,
opportunities and threats? They each have their part to play in your
plan. Let's hope you haven't missed anything.}
\subsubsection{Look}
Choose one for each:
Determined Eyes, Calculating Eyes, or Bored Eyes.

Neat Hair, Messy Hair, or Styled Hair.

Military Garb, Casual Clothes, or Formal Wear

\subsubsection{Stats}
Choose one set:
\begin{itemize}

\end{itemize}

Your Max Health and Max Load are both 4+Hard.

\subsubsection{Philosophy}
Choose one:
\paragraph{Yin:} Kill someone to tie up loose ends.
\paragraph{Yang:} Avoid an unecessary death.

\subsubsection{Introductions}
At the start of the first session, or when a new character joins, go round for introductions.
When you introduce your character, answer the following questions out loud:
\begin{itemize}
\item What do you look like? What impression does that give?
\item What do people think you're like? What about after they talk to you for five minutes?
\item In what way is people's first impression of you wrong or not quite the full story?
\end{itemize}

Then ask at least one of the following of the other characters:
\begin{itemize}
\item "Which one of you evidently distrusts me?" Whoever answers, offer that player 1-interest.
\item "Which one of you do I consider the most capable?" Whoever answers, offer that player 1-interest.
\end{itemize}
Tell the others 0-interest.

After each other character's introduction:
\begin{itemize}
\item Choose one and tell them "I've been studying you closely for some time." Your interest in them is 2 regardless of what they offer you.
\item Choose one and tell them "I consider you unpredictable." Your interest in them is 2 regardless of what they offer you.
\item You’ve done your homework. Your interest in the others is 1 more than whatever they offer you.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Starting Moves}
You start with \linkmove{Bodyguard} and \linkmove{Command}, plus two moves from the others below:

\subsubsection{Bodyguard}\label{sec:Bodyguard}
You have a bodyguard: a loyal protector who will serve you to the death. Name them and give them a one-line description.

Choose a base:
\begin{itemize}
\item Training $+2$, Cunning $+1$, 1 Armour, Humanity $+1$
\item Training $+2$, Cunning $+2$, 0 Armour, Humanity $+1$
\item Training $+1$, Cunning $+2$, 1 Armour, Humanity $+1$
\item Training $+3$, Cunning $+1$, 1 Armour, Humanity $+2$
\end{itemize}

Choose as many strengths as their Training:

\textit{Fast, burly, calm, intimidating, perceptive, stealthy, ferocious.}

Your bodyguard protects you from attackers. Choose as many additional trainings as their Cunning:

\textit{Search, scout, guard, gather information, repair, work for money, teach.}

Choose as many weaknesses as their Humanity:

\textit{Cowardly, insane, scarred, oblivious, ambitious, stubborn, lame.}

\subsubsection{Command}\label[sec:Command]
As well as protecting you from attackers, your bodyguard can also attack targets for you. When you \textbf{use your bodyguard as a weapon}, Roll+Cunning for any moves triggered instead of whatever that move demands. Your bodyguard inflicts harm equal to their Training.

Otherwise, when you work with your bodyguard on something they're trained in:
\begin{itemize}
\item and you attack the same target, add their Training to your damage.
\item and you take damage, add their armour to your armour.
\item and you put your heads together, add their Cunning to any roll you make.
%\item and you Defy, add their cunning to your roll.
\end{itemize}

\movefail{Best-Laid Plans}{start the session}{Plan}{hold 3}{hold 2}{hold 1, plus whatever the GM says when you spend it}

You may spend your hold 1-for-1 at any time during the session to have one of the following effects occur, either because you planned it or by pure luck:
\begin{itemize}
\item One weapon is disabled or broken.
\item One object explodes.
\item You come across a needed item.
\end{itemize}

% Idea: give each character a role, and they get +1 forward when acting in accordance with their role?
\move{Mission Briefing}{explain your plan to the other players}{Talk, describing up to 3 details.}{the plan is foolproof, and fills your comrades with hope: everyone present takes $+1$ forward now, and again when sticking to the plan.}{the plan is sound: everyone present takes $+1$ when sticking to it.}

\movedesc{Attention to Detail}{analyse a situation or try to figure someone out}{you are not restricted to the questions on the list.}
